# Python crash course (for INF264: Introduction to machine learning)

Welcome to this repository where you can find **a python crash course** that was designed to help students who did not have the necessary background in python at the start of our machine learning course **[INF264: Introduction to machine learning](https://www4.uib.no/en/courses/INF264)**! INF264 is run by the University of Bergen (Norway) and is a part of the machine learning specialisation of the master program in informatics offered by the department of Informatics of the University of Bergen. INF264 assumes that the students have no a priori knowledge in machine learning but do have some notions of python.

## Content

This python crash course is specially targetting the tools that we need at the start of INF264, namely:

- basic python types, functions, `if`, `for` and `while` statements and the very basics of the library `numpy`.
- In addition, to help students implement their own decision tree as a part of their first mandatory project, the second tutorial cover recursion, object-oriented programming and an example of a class implementing a basic tree.
