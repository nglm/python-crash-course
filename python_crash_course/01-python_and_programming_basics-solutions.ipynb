    "  - An [Iterable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterable) is a Python object capable of returning its members one at a time. Iterables include all sequence types (list, str, tuple, etc) and some non-sequence types like dictionaries\n",
    "  - A [Sequence](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range) in Python is an object of datatype string, list, tuples, and range for example (we will see that later). Sequences have a deterministic ordering. \n",
    "  - A [dictionary](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict) is an unordered collection of ``key : value`` items (we will see that later too)\n",
    "  - [range(start, stop[, step])](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-range) Gives an immutable sequence of numbers (from ``start`` to ``end-1``)\n",

It is usually used when the number of iterations is not fixed and/or not easy to know in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```if``` statement\n",
    "  - [if](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-if-statement) statements are used to write blocs of code that should be executed only if some condition is satisfied.

    "3. It returns a string. It doesn't print anything.\n",
    "4. ``greetings01`` has 0 parameter and ``greetings03`` has 3 parameters\n",
    "5. Both ``42.0`` and ``-1.2`` satisfy none of the 4 conditions associated with the ``if`` and ``elif`` statements. Then they are in the ``else`` case - which is the \"Hello\" case\n",
    "6. ``time`` parameter in ``greetings03`` and ``greetings04``\n",
    "   1. In ``greetings04``, ``time`` argument is optional and its default value is ``-1``\n",
    "   2. If an *optional argument* is omitted when calling a function, then it takes its default value. Therefore, when ``time`` is omitted its value is its default one, which is ``-1`` here.\n",
    "   3. If a *positional argument* is omitted then a [TypeError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError) error is raised that says \"``<your_function_here>() missing 1 required positional argument: '<your_argument_here>'``\"\n",
    "   \n",
    "7. function ``count_vowels_with_for``: ``in`` keyword in a ``for`` statement and in a condition:\n",
    "   1. In a ``for element in iterable`` statement, the keyword ``in`` means that at each iteration we get the next ``element`` stored *in* ``iterable``. In a ``if`` statement, ``in`` means that we check if a ``element`` is *in* ``iterable``\n",
    "   2. ``character`` successively gets the value ``'G'``, ``'i'``,``'m'``,``'l'`` and ``'i'``.\n",
    "   3. It can either be [True](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#True) or [False](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#False)\n",
    "   \n",
    "8. ``count += 1`` is a shorthand for ``count = count + 1``. This kind of assignment is one of the \"[Augmented assignments](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#augmented-assignment-statements)\" available in Python.\n",
    "9.  ``count += 1`` is executed only when the condition ``(name[i] in upper_case_vowels) or (name[i] in lower_case_vowels)`` is satisfied. In words that means that it is executed only when ``character`` is a vowel.\n",
    "10. It returns an integer ``count`` that is equal to the number of vowel in the string ``\"Gimli\"``. So it returns ``2``\n",
    "11. It is ``for`` first because we know how many iterations we need and also because we iterate over a iterable (the string ``name``) which can be very easily done in Python with a ``for`` loop thanks to the ``in`` keyword.\n"

    "   1. The idea would be to make sure indices are not out of range to avoid an [IndexError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IndexError) exception.\n",
    "   2. If an *optional argument* is omitted when calling a function, then it takes its default value. Therefore, when ``end`` is omitted its value is its default one, which is [None](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None) here. Then, inside the function when ``end`` is [None](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None) the value ``start + 1`` is assigned to ``end``\n",
    "   3. It would return ``\"5\"``\n",
    "   4. No, see question above, the string returned should have been of length 3 but it is only of length 1 because ``end`` was too high\n",
    "   5. By assuming that the returned string is longer that it is in reality you could try to access an index out of range later on when manipulating this output value.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. On the function ``normalize_list``\n",
    "   1. The idea is that it normalizes any non-zero list\n",
    "   2. It initializes a list of length ``len(iterable)`` whose elements are defined by ``expression`` Usually this expression depends on ``element``\n",
    "   3. It would return ``[0, 0, 0, 0]`` because then ``norm = 0`` after the ``for`` loop and is then considered as [False](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#False) in the ``if`` statement (See section Booleans above)"
